# CSC224: Intermediate Programming In C#
A repository containing multiple small projects for my CSC 224 class, Intermediate Programming in C#, that was taught by Dr. Blase Cindric.

This class uses exercises and assignments from "Murach's C# 2015" by Anne Boehm and Joel Murach.

Some code is supplied by Dr. Blase Cindric or the Murach textbook and edited by Alec Barker.

It contains projects that do the following:
- lab01/FinancialCalculations: Provided by Murach textbook to show some capabilities of Visual Studio
- lab01/InvoiceTotal: A simple Windows form that calculates discounts based on the amount of money the user enters
- lab02/InvoiceTotal: Similar to lab01/InvoiceTotal but adds additional information fields
- lab03/FutureValue: Calculates the amount of money a user will have based on their monthly investments, interest rate, and number of years investing
- lab03/InvoiceTotal: Calculated discounts based on amount of money the user enters and the type of customer
- lab04/FutureValue: Similar to lab03/FutureValue but clears the Future Value field when the user begins typing in any text field
- lab04/InvoiceTotal: Similar to lab01/InvoiceTotal but uses a try/catch block and displays a MessageBox in case of an error
