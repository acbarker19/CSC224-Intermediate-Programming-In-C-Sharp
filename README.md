# CSC224: Intermediate Programming In C#
A repository containing multiple small projects for my CSC 224 class, Intermediate Programming in C#, that was taught by Dr. Blase Cindric.

This class uses exercises and assignments from "Murach's C# 2015" by Anne Boehm and Joel Murach.

Some code is supplied by Dr. Blase Cindric or the Murach textbook and edited by Alec Barker.

It contains projects that do the following:
- lab01/FinancialCalculations: Provided by Murach textbook to show some capabilities of Visual Studio
- lab01/InvoiceTotal: A simple Windows form that calculates discounts based on the amount of money the user enters
- lab02/InvoiceTotal: Similar to lab01/InvoiceTotal but adds additional information fields
- lab03/FutureValue: Calculates the amount of money a user will have based on their monthly investments, interest rate, and number of years investing
- lab03/InvoiceTotal: Calculated discounts based on amount of money the user enters and the type of customer
- lab04/FutureValue: Similar to lab03/FutureValue but clears the Future Value field when the user begins typing in any text field
- lab04/InvoiceTotal: Similar to lab01/InvoiceTotal but uses a try/catch block and displays a MessageBox in case of an error
- lab05: Allows the user to browse for a file, reads the file, and displays an edited version of the text in a TextBox
- lab06/DateHandling: Uses DateTimes to determine the number of days between days entered by the user and the current date
- lab06/lab06: Users can select arrival and departure dates with DateTimePickers, and the program will calculate the price for staying at the hotel for that number of days
- lab07/ListOfObjects: Users can browse for a file, the text from the file is read and converted to Vehicle objects, and information about each Vehicle is displayed in a TextBox. A framework was also created for adding new Vehicles
- PA1/IRA Calculator: Users can enter name, age, planned retirement age, a fixed annual investment, and an interest rate, and the program will calculate how much money they will have saved for retirement
- PA2: Users enter the number of sales for each month in a year, and the program will display a graph with a * for every sale in a month
- PA3: User specify a file with data for credit card charges, the program neatly organizes the raw data, and a file is output with the organized data
